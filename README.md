# React + Vite

The file setup-react-components.sh is a script that handles the changes from Basic HTML to a React environment. Since this is a one time change, there is no need to run the script again.

This is the commands that were used to install and run the project:
```
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
npm i
npm run dev
```


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
